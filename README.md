**iMazing-Malware-Analyzer** is a module in iMazing's C++ toolkit which implements spyware detection methodologies mirroring that of [Amnesty International's MVT project](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt).

This project cannot be built, it is published for transparency purposes. If you wish to contribute, please do so on the MVT repo and not here â€“ we watch MVT closely and will update this repository when significant methodology changes occur there. 

This project is not affiliated to or endorsed by Amnesty International. Please read [this blog post](https://imazing.com/blog/detect-pegasus-and-other-spyware-on-iphone) for more context on our implementation of MVT.
